            <p>How to support someone who's been raped</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Recognising the different behaviours they may exhibit; hyper sexuality, or desiring no sex at all, they may even be more afraid of sexual interactions and closeness.
                </li>
                <li>If they choose to disclose this to you, let them know:</li>
                <li>That you can take them to the police station to make a report.</li>
                <li>You can call rape services to get them support to talk to someone who can advise and support them through this.</li>
                <li>You'll be there for them whenever they need.</li>
                <li>If they need space, still maintain contact to show them you are there and that you care about their well being.</li>
                <li>Help them talk to people  who have also suffered through something similar, so they can hear how other survivors were able to move forward with their lives.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Trigger Warning

                Understanding consent and enjoying having sex with someone who also wants to enjoy the experience, seems to be lost in this world. The amount of sexual assult thats occurs, and how many cases actually get reported is ridiculous. You will come across many people in your life who have been through sexual assault, and I have searched for many websites to see if there is any information that shows how to support someone who has been sexually assaulted. To my surprise there are many websites that report statistics of rape, but not a single website has outlined a set plan on how to provide support. So, this is me giving it a go and my hope is that this helps someone going through something similar, or is supporting someone who has been through such a traumatic experience.
            </p>
            <p>I'll let you know a little bit about myself, I have been raped 4 or 5 times in my life. I have always blamed myself in this journey and I have also met many people who have also been raped. We have all been supporting one another to not let this experience control us and our lives, and make us lose the will to live. I have tried to end my life many times after these incidents, and it has contributed to the decline in my mental health making it difficult to get through life. I have been walking around carrying my anger, feeling hopeless thinking that these abusers get away with what they do whilst I suffer. Having to deal with various intrusive thoughts make it hard for me to work, and continue to cause distress in several aspects of my life. I am writing this for myself and others who have suffered, just know: <strong> WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS</strong> The message I want to depart is this: karma does exist even though we may not be able to see it, these abusers will get what's coming to them.</p>
            <p>My most recent rape happened in 2018 I was drugged and raped by a stranger then was raped by my ex partner which caused a lot of shock in me. I reported the rape where I was drugged and raped however this case was dropped and I am still waiting on an explanation as to why is was dropped. I understand why people do not like reporting to the police due to so many cases being dropped and not getting enough attention that they deserve. However this should not prevent people from reporting as I truly do believe if someone has raped more than once they will get caught and get the punishment they deserve.</p>

            <h2><u>Understanding Side Effects</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Black outs, where I can sit and my mind will go completely black and I forget my memories and any tasks that need to be done</li>
                <li>Panic attacks, I start to hyperventilate where I struggle to control my breathing and feel nauseated.</li>
                <li>Intrusive thoughts, seeing flashbacks of the event, seeing sexual images with people even children which has been extremely difficult to manage. It is important you understand that this is a normal side effect so if they do disclose let them know this is not a concern. </li>
                <li>OCD, I would worry that my actions would cause more hurt, I started creating rituals to help me deal with this which lead me to create different unhealthy habits.</li>
                <li>PTSD, characterised by continuos flashbacks, panic attacks, anger, physical violence, trying to protect others in a combative manner.</li>
                <li>Traits of Bipolar, with mood swings switching from extreme highs to extreme lows.</li> 
                <li>Risky behaviours, such as spending money when I didn't have any to spend and participating in many spontaneous dangerous events. </li>
                <li> Understanding autism because of the way my mind is receiving information I understood how difficult it is for people who have an Atypical brain. For example every sensory information that is otherwise easily processed would turn extremely loud and everything visually would change in size.</li>
                <li>Defensiveness, extreme paranoia believing that people are following me, recording me, laughing at me. This lead to extreme bursts of anger resulting in trying to fight people in order to realise the anger and alleviate the hurt i felt.</li>
                <li> Stockholme Syndrome where I fell in love with my abuser, felt the love for more abuse and felt like I deserved this. So I would go to places to feel clsoer to my abuser and listen to music that would remind me of my abuser. This then lead to me wishing I would get hurt and raped again as this is the life I deserve. Seeing my abuser in every person I meet and giving the energy I had with the abuser to feel that same rush of adrenaline and fear again. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You have to understand these side effects clearly so you know how to set clear boundaries with the victim but also able to show them support by listening to them giving them a space to let out their pain and anger boxing, any form of martial arts, a place they can scream axe throwing, karaoke can be good to to let out stress. Take them with you as they will beed your support to really trust you slowly they will start going by themselves.</p>

            <h2><u>How to Report</u></h2>
            <p>Take them to the police station with any evidence they may have of the incident as this will make their claim stronger.
                If they have told you about the incident days after it happened this may affect the results of the case, however do still encourage them to report as this may help create a stronger case against the abuser especially if this brings up any previous convictions they may have.
                If you do not feel comfortable leaving the house and making the report just call 999 and tell them you would like to report a sexual abuse case and they will come to your house and start the case.</p>
                <p>You can also call the Havens and they can help you write a case to help get the police involved.</p>
